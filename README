MAIN FEATURES


- The walk parameters are controlled through the UI.

- The program also supports 3d (only in interactive-mode).
- The program supports two main modes: interactive, and non-interactive (controlled by the "interactive?" checkbox).
  - In interactive-mode, the walk is visualized on the screen (with matplotlib).
  - In non-interactive-mode, the program runs several experiments with different num-of-steps,
    and outputs the experiment-results into files.
    - charts are outputted into "png" files and a "stats.csv" file:
      avg_distance_from_origin.png
      avg_distance_from_x_axis.png
      avg_distance_from_y_axis.png
      avg_num_steps_to_exit_circle.png
      avg_total_walker_crosse_y_axis.png

- The walker-types are as follows:
  - walker1: moves 1 unit in a random direction (out of 360).
  - walker2: moves randomly between [0.5,1.5] units in a random direction (out of 360).
  - walker3: moves 1 unit in a random direction out of 4 (Up,Down,Right,left).
  - walker4: biased walk - moves 1 unit in a random direction out of 360, but is biased towards the origin.
  - walker5: same as walker1, but makes bigger steps.
  - walker6: same as walker1, but has a 50% change to 'take a rest'.

- The program supports few types of elements (supports 2d and 3d):
  - obstacles: a list of points that the walker cannot cross.
  - portals: a list of points that if the walker crossed them ,the walker teleports to other point in universe.
  -black holes (only in 3d):  if the walker crosse the 'horizon event' it will be sucked into the blackhole and will never return.
  the horizon event was created with physics formulas of gravitational force, taking notice of the mass of a walker and
  the mass of the black hole. the formula used was F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2
  where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of the walker, m2 is the mass of the black hole
  and r is the distance between the walker and the black hole.
  traps- if the walker crosse the trap, he cannot walk out of it.
  slow zones- if the walker crosse the slow zone, he will move slower.

  The program supports also:
  -restart option (check box): if checked, there will be a probability that the walker will teleport to the origin and keep walking from there.
  - ice option (check box): if checked, there will  be a probability that the frame will pause in slower pace, so we can analyze the walk better.
